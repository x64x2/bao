.. note::

   * **What is the rationale for building TalkyTrader?**

    * Create an open source platform to allow trading on DEX and CEX on any messaging platform and empower trader with trading tools regardless of the instrument type. Key focus on DEX capability as priority.

    * "so happy I spent $200 on trading signals" said no trader ever. This is a tool to enable traders. This is not a signal platform and not a trading strategy tool. Assumption is you have a `strategy <https://www.investopedia.com/beginner-trading-strategies-4689644>`_.

   * **Aren't there already projects that do this?**

    * Project available usually focused on a given messaging platform (e.g. telegram), a given type of exchange (usually binance), a given type of trading (snipping DEX https://github.com/Nafidinara/bot-pancakeswap or CEX) or full suite trading with CEX focus (https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot, https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot).
